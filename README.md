##[Feed the Beast forum post] (http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/16x-familiar-yet-different-ftb-wip.633/)
***
##Distribution

Anyone can redistribute the texture pack modified or not as long as I am given credit.

This said I have had some help from a few community members.

For a full list of help see the Contributors.txt.
***
##Usage

If anyone needs help starting on textures feel free to use the pack as a base.

If you do use the pack please let people know and link back to the thread.
***
##Purpose

The purpose of this is to let people know how I do things.

It is also here to show just how many file/folders/textures need to be made/modified to make a texture pack.

This is also here so that anyone that wants to help in the creation of the pack can.

Anyone that helps with texturing in any way will have there name added to the Contributors.txt.
***
##Other

If you did actually read all of this make a post about it and leave some feed-back on the forum post.

It is okay to correct my grammar/spelling just don't get overbearing.

Also a special thanks to AbrarSyed for his help with the gradle build script.
