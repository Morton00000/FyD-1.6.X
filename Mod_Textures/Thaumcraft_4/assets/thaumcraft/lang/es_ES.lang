# Research entries
tc.research_name.RESEARCH=Research
tc.research_text.RESEARCH=How you discover things
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.1=Before you can build most thaumaturgical items and blocks, you first need to discover how to do so. There are several steps in this process:<BR>(1) Exploring the world and examining blocks, items and creatures with a ¬ß5Thaumometer¬ß0<BR><BR>(2) Taking the research points you gathered from the first step and expanding your aspect knowledge with the ¬ß5Research Table¬ß0<BR><BR>(3) Using the aspects you know and discovering practical knowledge and recipes with the ¬ß5Research Table¬ß0.<LINE>
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.2=¬ßl      ¬ßn(1) Exploration¬ßr<BR><BR>You cannot perform research without research points, and the best way to gain research points is by exploration and examining object in the world.<BR>The first thing you will need to do is construct a ¬ß5Thaumometer¬ß0 (see next page). By pointing the ¬ß5Thaumometer¬ß0 at objects or creatures and holding the right mouse button you will start examining them. The process does not take long, but your movement speed is reduced while it is occurring.<BR>Once complete the ¬ß5Thaumometer¬ß0 will display what aspects the object contains. In the bottom right of the screen you will also see a summary of the aspects and research points 
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.3=you discovered.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research1.png:0:0:255:208:.5</IMG>You will initially not be able to examine all objects since you have not discovered their component aspects. For example, a object containing the Lux aspect can only be examined if you have previously discovered the Lux aspect, or know
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.4=the two aspects that combine to create it.<BR>The very first time you discover an aspect by examining something you gain double the number of research points you would have normally.<BR>Objects and creatures can usually only ever be examined once.<BR>While exploring the world and examining things it is always a good idea to keep a filled set of ¬ß5scribing tools¬ß0 and some ¬ß5paper¬ß0 on you. Occasionally examining something will reveal additional clues and insights into thaumoturgical research, often resulting in a set of research notes that you can research further.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.5=¬ßl   ¬ßn(2) Combining Aspects¬ßr<BR><BR>Once you have gathered some research points you can attempt to combine them into compound aspects within a research table.<BR>To craft a research table simply place two ¬ß5tables¬ß0 next to each other and click on them with a set of Scribing Tools. The recipe for tables is listed under the ¬ß5Artiface¬ß0 research category.<BR>If you open the research tables inventory, you will see an interface as pictured on the right.<BR>The scribing tools you used to craft the table will be located in slot ¬ßl1¬ßr.

Section ¬ßl8¬ßr will also display the research sheet covered in a bewildering array of runes and symbols that looks something like the image at the top of the previous page.<BR>Don't worry, it is not as hard as it looks.<LINE>To complete your research you simply need to connect and activate all the ¬ß5knowledge nodes¬ß0 (pictured below).<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/gui/guiresearchtable.png:184:224:16:8:1.5</IMG>The node on the left is an inactive node, while the node on the right has been activated. Once all the

The rune/aspect link is unique to each research subject, so a rune that might represent Aer this time, might represent Terra next time.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.11=Not all the runes are valid for the current subject you are researching.<BR>For example though there might be runes for Aer, Terra, Ignes and Aqua on the research sheet, only Ignes and Terra might actually be valid. Invalid runes are often called 'red herring' runes.<BR> You discover which runes are valid by selecting an aspect on the left, and pressing the 'Research' button (¬ßl6¬ßr). If the aspect you selected is valid, then all runes linked to that aspect will become active.<BR>If the aspect you select is a 'red herring' then the runes linked to it will not activate, but up to two of them will be removed from the sheet entirely.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.12=If the aspect you select is not present on the research table then nothing happens.<LINE>Active runes act as possible bridges to connect knowledge nodes. A glowing line of energy will flow from an active knowledge node to any active rune nearby. You need to create a chain of active runes and nodes to complete the research.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research3.png:0:0:120:95:.75</IMG>
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.13=A chain cannot form if there is more than one open space between a active runes or nodes.<BR>To form a chain you must move the runes around by clicking on a rune and selecting a valid destination.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research2.png:136:0:102:74:1</IMG>Each rune can be moved up to 2 positions in a straight line, but only inactive runes can be moved - this means you might have to activate and deactivate your valid runes several
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.14=times to get them into position.<BR>Inactive runes prevent the forming of a connection if they lie in its path, so you need to move them out of the way.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research3.png:128:0:105:111:.75</IMG>Moving runes uses a small amount of ink each time you do it.<LINE>

tc.research_page.KNOWFRAG.1=In your travels you might happen upon fragments of ancient and lost knowledge. On their own they aren't worth much, but if you gather enough of them together you might gain unique research that you can pursue. Usually the research they reveal cannot be gained through normal means.<BR>The fragments of knowledge can on occasion lead to a false theory, but this will be revealed when you attempt to research it. When this happens most of your knowledge fragments will be returned to you and it usually means you have exhausted all current avenues of research into lost knowledge.

tc.research_name.ASPECTS=Aspects of Magic
tc.research_text.ASPECTS=The building blocks of magic
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.1=Every item, object or creature is bound by varying mystical elements known as ¬ß5aspects¬ß0. Aspects describe the objects makeup and bent towards the magical elements. A simple stone may possess the aspect of Saxum while more complex items like trees or even creatures can be made up of various different aspects in varying amounts. There are close to 50 known aspects with more being discovered all the time.<LINE>There are two main types of aspects: ¬ß5Primal¬ß0 and ¬ß5Compound¬ß0.
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.2=¬ßlPrimal Aspects¬ßr are the most basic types of aspects and there are only 6 of them: ¬ß6Aer¬ß0 (air), ¬ß2Terra¬ß0 (earth), ¬ßcIgnis¬ß0 (fire), ¬ß3Aqua¬ß0 (Water), ¬ßfOrdo¬ß0 (order), ¬ß8Perditio¬ß0 (entropy).<BR>These form the basic building blocks of all other aspects.<BR>¬ßlCompound Aspects¬ßr are built from two other aspects. The simplest compound aspects are made from two primal aspects, but it is possible to have incredibly complex compound aspects made from successive layers of simpler aspects.<BR>The simplest example of such a compound aspect, is the aspect of Victus (life) that is a combination of Terra and Aqua. 
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.3=To view what aspects an item possesses, simply hover your cursor over the item and press sneak (shift), and you will see what aspects that item has and what amounts of each. You will first need to study the item however, until then the aspects will remain unknown.<LINE>Aspects that have somehow been separated from their object and purified is known as ¬ß5Vis¬ß0 and is very valuable: both as a crafting ingredient and as a subject for magical research.<BR>Vis is most often bound into wands, but it is also possible to store it as a magical liquid. Vis stored as a liquid is known as ¬ß5Essentia¬ß0.

tc.research_name.NODES=Auras and Nodes
tc.research_text.NODES=Magic is everywhere
tc.research_page.NODES.1=The ¬ß5Aura¬ß0 is a field of magical energy prevalent throughout the world. Its origin is unclear. Some believe it is the accumulated life force of living beings, while others believe it to merely be another type of energy seeping in from some other place. The last theory seems to be most likely, as the aura is often found surrounding a node of concentrated mystical energy known as an ¬ß5Aura Node¬ß0.<BR>Each aura node has a base amount of magical energy it can contain and this energy is aligned to one or more aspects. It is usually aligned to ¬ß5Primal Aspects¬ß0, but rarely a node may contain ¬ß5Compound Aspects¬ß0. 
tc.research_page.NODES.2=The aspects within an aura node can be tapped by a thaumaturge for his own purposes. The simplest way to do so is with the use of a wand.<BR>Energy that has been harvested in this manner is known as vis.<LINE>Aura nodes are hard to see with the naked eye, but faint glimmers of light often betray their presence. The ¬ß5Thaumometer¬ß0 makes nodes slightly easier to find, as looking through its lens makes them clearly visible.<BR>¬ß4Important:¬ß0 Caution must be taken when draining a node. There is a small chance that when a specific type of aspect within a node is completely drained, it may 
tc.research_page.NODES.3=disappear or harm the integrity of the node.<BR>It is possible for the node to disappear completely if all the aspects disappear.<LINE>Fortunately most nodes replenish their aspects over time and if properly maintained can provide a clever thaumaturge with all the vis he could want.

tc.research_page.DECONSTRUCTOR.1=There comes a point in any thaumaturge's career where he is unable to progress with research due to his lack of knowledge. <BR>One possible recourse is the Deconstruction Table. The table allows you to break down objects into their simplest parts which you can examine. There are limits however - the table breaks compound aspects into their component aspects until only primal aspects remain. During this process much knowledge is lost and at best the thaumaturge can hope for is a single piece of primal knowledge.<BR>For example cobblestone (saxum and 
tc.research_page.DECONSTRUCTOR.2=perditio) will be simplified into 2 terra and 1 perditio, only one of which will have a chance of being discovered.<BR>It is also fairly slow and the fewer aspects and object has, the lower the chance to discover something.

The replenish the energy in a wand, you must right-click and hold to draw vis from an aura node.<BR>While holding a wand you will see a indicator on the top left of the screen that shows how much vis is stored within the wand.
tc.research_page.BASICTHAUMATURGY.2=Holding shift will display exact numbers held by the wand and any possible discounts you have to performing magical tasks.<BR>Wands are always constructed by the combination of a rod and two end-caps. As you progress with your studies, you are sure you will discover different materials that you can use to craft rods and caps to make powerful wands. Only the basic wand can be put together in a normal crafting table. All other wands require the ¬ß5Arcane Workbench¬ß0 and will cost vis to construct.<BR>The basic wand is constructed from mundane wood and iron, both of which make poor materials for working magic.

It allows him to render physical objects into their component Essentia and recombine it again as he wishes.<BR>The crucible needs to be placed over a source of constant heat and filled with water. Once the water starts boiling you simply throw any items you wish into the crucible and they will be broken down into their component Essentia.<BR>If you know the proper formula and the mix of essentia within the    
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.2=crucible is correct, you can then drop a special item into the crucible known as a Catalyst. The catalyst draws the essentia into itself and transforms into a whole new item that the crucible then ejects.<BR>Any leftover Essentia remains within the crucible for further use, but it is not a good idea to leave essentia within a crucible for too long.<BR>Crafting also uses some of the water within the crucible and you will eventually need to refill it.<BR>Essentia within the crucible is constantly degrading. Compound essentia degrades into one of its component aspects, and Primal essentia simply evaporates.  
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.3=Beyond the waste of resources, evaporating and degrading essentia can cause many strange side-effects.<BR>You can empty a crucible by right-clicking on it with a wand. All the essentia is dumped into the atmosphere... not something you would want to do too often.

tc.research_name.ENCHFABRIC=Enchanted Fabric
tc.research_text.ENCHFABRIC=Silky and Stylish
tc.research_page.ENCHFABRIC.1=By combining spider silk and wool and infusing it with primal vis, you have created a silky length of magical cloth that would have numerous uses.<BR>You have also discovered patterns to create cloth robes from the magical fabric. These robes have similar protective properties to leather armor, but they are much more durable than mundane materials could ever be.<BR>They also hold mystical enchantments very well and can hold powerful magic much better than even expensive armor.  
tc.research_page.ENCHFABRIC.2=The various pieces of this outfit grant a small discount to the amount of vis drained from casting wands when you use them.<BR>You can dye the armor like you would leather armor.

tc.research_name.ELEMENTALAXE=Axe of the Stream
tc.research_text.ELEMENTALAXE=Rivers of Wood
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALAXE.1=By combining water shards and a thaumium axe, you have created a tool that embodies the aspects of motion and flow.<BR>It functions like a normal axe on all materials except natural logs and trees. When used on them the axe seeks to furthest block of the same type that is still connected to the block you are attempting to harvest and harvests that one instead.<BR>In effect you will chop trees from the top down even if you hit the bottom-most block. 
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALAXE.2=In addition all blocks harvested in this manner will automatically flow towards you to be collected.<BR>If you press and hold right click the axe will harvest at a much faster speed, but at a greater cost to its durability.<BR>If shift is held while using this tool all its special properties are suspended and it functions like a normal axe.#

tc.research_name.ELEMENTALHOE=Hoe of Growth
tc.research_text.ELEMENTALHOE=Balance of Nature
tc.research_page.ELEMENTALHOE.1=By merging the magical energy from order and entropy shards with a thaumium hoe, you have created a farming implement with few equals.<BR>When used to till fields, it will till a 3x3 area instead of just a single block.<BR>When used to crops or other plants it will act as bonemeal to promote its growth, though at a higher cost to its durability. It might even be able to grow plants that normal bonemeal can't.<BR>If shift is held while using this tool all its special properties are suspended and it functions like a normal hoe.

tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.1=You see a future need where you will need ready access to multiple different kinds of aspects - not just primal aspects drawn from your wand.<BR>Using basic alchemical principles you have divised a way to break down objects and convert them into essentia.<BR>The first step in this process requires an ¬ßlAlchemical Furnace¬ßr. The alchemical furnace works much like a normal furnace by burning coal to produce heat, but instead of smelting ore into metal, it breaks down objects into a slurry of raw, unprocessed essentia.
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.2=The next step in the process is to take the essentia slurry and distill it using an ¬ßlArcane Alembic¬ßr.<BR>To work, arcane alembics need to be placed on top of an alchemy furnace. The essentia slurry will slowly be drawn into the alembic and the indivual aspected essentia separated out.<BR>If the alchemical furnace is being powered by alumentum, this distillation process is much faster.<BR>You can stack up to 5 different alembics on top if a single furnace.<BR>The essentia can then be extracted out of an alembic using phials.
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.3=As an alternative essentia can also be stored in ¬ßlWarded Jars¬ßr.<BR>Warded jars can be placed in world and is able to store essentia virtually indefinitely. The enchantments placed on the jars also makes adding or extracting essentia a breeze.<BR>Jars placed under the spout of an alembic will be automatically filled. They can also be filled and emptied using phials.<BR>What is more they make an excellent storage medium for jams en preserves.

tc.research_text.INFERNALFURNACE=Hot enough?
tc.research_page.INFERNALFURNACE.1=By harnessing raw ¬ßcIgnis¬ß0 within a furnace crafted from obsidian and netherbrick you have created a highly efficient and fuel free furnace. So efficient in fact, that occasionally it will produce bonus materials in the form of nuggets or other items.<BR>While this is essentially free, it is also very slow unless the furnace gets a new supply of ¬ßcIgnis¬ß0 essentia every now and again. This can be done by placing a jar of ¬ßcIgnis¬ß0 essentia within line of sight of the front of the furnace, somewhere within 10 blocks. Luckily a little essentia goes a long way.
tc.research_page.INFERNALFURNACE.2=It should also be noted that the occasional bit of Flux escapes into the environment.<BR>Items you wish to smelt needs to be dropped into the top of the furnace and will be spit out the front.

tc.research_text.BELLOWS=Stoking the flames
tc.research_page.BELLOWS.1=The Arcane Bellows performs much the same function as its mundane counterpart, the only difference is that it happily pumps away by itself sending forth a stream of neverending air.<BR>Attaching it to an Infernal Furnace has shown some interesting results. The elemental infused air not only stokes the flames increasing its smelting speed, but causes them to burn much purer, resulting in a reduction of flux generated and increasing the chance of creating bonus nuggets and other materials when smelting.
tc.research_page.BELLOWS.2=They can also be attached to normal or alchemical furnaces to increase their speed.<BR>It is also possible to attach them to crucibles to reduce the time it takes for their water to boil.<BR>You are confident more uses will reveal themselves eventually.

tc.research_name.INFUSION=Infusion
tc.research_text.INFUSION=Mystical fusion
tc.research_page.INFUSION.1=Arcane crafting and alchemy can go only so far. Something better is needed to create truly powerful mystical objects.<BR>Infusion crafting is the process of infusing a single object with magical energy and the properties of other objects. You could, for example, infuse a stone with aer vis and a feather and it would result in a very light stone.<BR>As is usual with thaumaturgy, things are not quite that simple. To even get started with infusion crafting there are several things you need: A Runic Matrix, arcane pedestals and a ready supply of magic in the form of essentia. 
tc.research_page.INFUSION.2=Once you have your Runic Matrix properly placed into a structure commonly known as an Infusion Altar, you can begin to craft.<BR>The central pedestal located under the matrix is where the item you wish to infuse will go. You will also need several more pedestals placed around the altar where you can place the blocks and items you wish to infuse into the target object. Lastly you will need warded jars or similar essentia containers holding the requisite amount of vis.<BR>Once all this is gathered you can click on the Runic Matrix with a wand to start the crafting process.<BR>During the first stage of crafting essentia will be drained
tc.research_page.INFUSION.3=from nearby sources. Crafting will stall of there is insufficient essentia available - something that you do not want as will be explained on following pages.<BR>Once all the required essentia has been infused into the target object, the other objects will have their essential essence drained. Only when this is done will the crafting process complete.<LINE>Infusion crafting is not without risks. The entire process involves forcing vast energies into a single object. Unpredictable things tend to happen.<BR>Usually one of the fusion objects get
tc.research_page.INFUSION.4=knocked off a pedestal, or flux gets generated, but more catastrophic events are not unheard of.<BR>The longer crafting continues due to unresolved problems like lack of vis or dropped items, the greater the chance of something bad happening.<BR>These effects can be reduced by various means. Firstly you wish to keep the entire fusion structure as symmetrical as possible - take careful note of where you place pedestals and make sure they are balanced with other pedestals on the opposite side of the altar. When placing fusion items into them you may wish to keep them balanced as well. Lastly you can place occult paraphernalia around the  
tc.research_page.INFUSION.5=altar in symmetrical formations (things like candles, skulls, crystals, etc.). These will have the effect of reducing instability.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research5.png:128:0:128:136:1</IMG>

tc.research_name.JARBRAIN=Brain in a Jar
tc.research_text.JARBRAIN=Sealing in the foulness
tc.research_page.JARBRAIN.1=- Throw one rotten zombie brain into a jar.<BR>- Add some spider eyes and water.<BR>- Stir gently with your wand while thinking dark thoughts.<BR>If you follow the recipe exactly you should now have a partially animated and fully malicious zombie brain.<BR>It retains some of the hunger it possessed as a zombie and while it cannot consume brains, it still enjoys eating the thoughts and experiences of those slain nearby. Giving its jar a good shake will make it surrender some of its ill-gotten gains for your own use.

tc.research_name.HOVERHARNESS=Thaumostatic Harness
tc.research_text.HOVERHARNESS=Is it a bird...
tc.research_page.HOVERHARNESS.1=You have finally managed to unlock the secret of flight. You have created a harness that anchors itself to the Thaumic Field using thaumostatic energy allowing you to defy gravity. You think quantum's and quarks might also be involved somehow.<BR>Unusually the only vis required to power this harness is added during its creation process. Instead the fuel it requires for flight is raw Potentia. Simply right click while holding the harness to insert filled jars.<BR>Double-tapping space while wearing the harness activates it.
tc.research_page.HOVERHARNESS.2=While active the harness will constantly use Potentia.<BR>It can be enchanted with the Haste enchant to increase the speed at which you move while flying.
#
tc.research_name.ADVANCEDGOLEM=Advanced Golems
tc.research_text.ADVANCEDGOLEM=Maybe I should think this through...
tc.research_page.ADVANCEDGOLEM.1=You have discovered a way of improving golems in several minor, but significant ways.<BR>Firstly, golems that go through this process are able to hold one additional upgrade, though they can never have more than two upgrades of a single type.<BR>Secondly, they move slightly faster.<BR>Thirdly, they have a slightly greater sight radius.<BR>You are sure the malevolant intent in their eyes is just your imagination.  
#
tc.research_name.ARCANEBORE=Arcane Bore
tc.research_text.ARCANEBORE=Mining evolved
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.1=You have discovered a device capable of extending the range and power of an Excavation focus. Of even greater use is the fact that the machine can do so without your constant supervision. You merely need to place it on a specially constructed base, point it in the right direction with a wand and apply a redstone signal.<BR>The arcane bore requires two things to function. The first is an excavation focus placed in its leftmost inventory slot. Any enchantments applied to the focus will also alter the functions of the bore. 
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.2=Secondly you need to place any kind of pickaxe into the rightmost slot. The material of the pickaxe will have little effect on the operation of the bore, but the greater its durability, the longer it will last. Like the wand, any enchantments or special abilities of the pickaxe will also be applied to whatever the bore mines.<BR>Placing a jar of perditio essentia somewhere behind the bore (within 5 blocks) will greatly speed up the rate at which it mines.<BR>An arcane bore can only be placed above or below an arcane bore base. Any items mined will be ejected from the base in the direction its nozzle is pointing. 
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.3=It will eject into an inventory if possible. This direction can be changed with a wand.
#
tc.research_name.LEVITATOR=Arcane Levitator
tc.research_text.LEVITATOR=Next best thing to flying
tc.research_page.LEVITATOR.1=While not true flight, the Arcane Levitator is the next best thing.<BR>When placed the levitator lifts any item or creature above it up to 10 blocks into the air. A sneaking creature or player will be slowly lowered.<BR>Each levitator placed upon another increases the range at which it can lift entities by 10 blocks, so a stack of 3 can lift entities up to 30 blocks.<BR>Levitators can be deactivated by applying a redstone signal to them.  
#
tc.research_name.ARCANEEAR=Arcane Ear
tc.research_text.ARCANEEAR=Shhh, do you hear something?
tc.research_page.ARCANEEAR.1=The Arcane Ear is a device that is capable of detecting the sound emitted from nearby note blocks. If it hears a note it recognizes it will emit a short redstone pulse.<BR>The Arcane Ear needs to be tuned in a manner identical to note blocks, the tone and note it listens for depends on the material it is placed upon.
#
tc.research_name.MIRROR=Mirror Magic
tc.research_text.MIRROR=Through the looking glass
tc.research_page.MIRROR.1=You are now able to enchant a pair of magical mirrors that act as doorways to the void between the worlds. Anything shoved through the one mirror will pass through this realm and exit through the other mirror - even across dimensional bounderies.<BR>Unfortunately this realm is extremely hostile to mortal creatures like yourself so using these mirrors to transport living creatures is not yet possible.<BR>To link a pair of these magical mirrors you simply need to place one of them in a desired location. You then right-click with a second  
tc.research_page.MIRROR.2=mirror on the one you placed, and the pair will become linked. You may then place the second wherever you wish and items thrown into one will be ejected out the other.<BR>Mirrors can only be linked in pairs, so while both are placed in the world and able to transmit items you cannot link them to another mirror. When you pick up a mirror it will remember the last partner it was linked with, allowing you to easily move it without having to relink it. However while one of the paired mirrors is picked up, you may easily relink either of them.
#
tc.research_name.MIRRORHAND=Magical Hand Mirror
tc.research_text.MIRRORHAND=Personal reflection
tc.research_page.MIRRORHAND.1=This magical hand mirror functions much the same way as other magical mirrors. You simply push items through the glass and they will pop out at the linked mirror.<BR>Simple right-click while holding the linked hand mirror and you will be able to place any items in your inventory into the looking glass to have them transported.<BR>The hand mirror can be linked to a mirror that is already paired with another.<BR>It should be noted that the hand mirror can only send items, not recieve them.
#
tc.research_name.NODEJAR=Node in a Jar
tc.research_text.NODEJAR=For the Thaumaturgist on the go
tc.research_page.NODEJAR.1=Warded jars have proven themselves capable of storing all manner of mundane and mystical things, and you believe you have discovered another use for them - trapping aura nodes.<BR>By constructing a large version of a jar around a node and enacting the proper mystical formula with your wand, the node will become trapped inside the construct which will quickly shrink to a more manageable size. The jar can then be safely picked up and moved around, but the initial trapping spell does have a very good chance of damageing the node.<BR>While trapped the node is kept suspended and will not regenerate vis, nor can vis be drawn from it.
tc.research_page.NODEJAR.2=It is possible to free the node from the jar by placing it in the world and clicking on it with a wand. The jar will be destroyed in the process.
#
tc.research_name.PAVETRAVEL=Paving Stone of Travel
tc.research_text.PAVETRAVEL=Easing your journey
tc.research_page.PAVETRAVEL.1=By altering the magical structure of arcane stone you are able to create a paving stone that adds new bounce to the step of anyone walking across it.<BR>Anything walking across it will have greater speed and agility for a couple of seconds.
#
tc.research_name.PAVEWARD=Paving Stone of Warding
tc.research_text.PAVEWARD=Keeping things out
tc.research_page.PAVEWARD.1=You have discovered a way of turning arcane stone blocks into mystical wards that will prevent most creatures from crossing them.<BR>It should be noted that these wards aren't always 100% foolproof and they cannot prevent other players from entering an area, but they keep most of common threats at bay. They will also prevent golems from crossing them.<BR>For best results you need an unbroken line of them between the area you wish to protect and the outside world.<BR>An active redstone signal will disable this block.
#
tc.research_name.WANDPED=Wand Recharge Pedestal
tc.research_text.WANDPED=Automated Wand Recharging
tc.research_page.WANDPED.1=Traveling around the countryside to recharge your wand is all good and well, but an automatic way of doing it would be much better.<BR>This specially crafted pedestal does just that - any wand placed in it will automatically draw vis from nearby nodes.<BR>Nodes will not be fully drained unless it is a poor quality wand crafted from iron or sticks.
#
tc.research_name.WANDPEDFOC=Compound Recharge Focus
tc.research_text.WANDPEDFOC=For everything a use
tc.research_page.WANDPEDFOC.1=In your travels you have discovered several nodes that contain compound aspects, but as yet there has been no way to tap this rich source of vis. Until now.<BR>This focus can be placed on top of a wand recharge pedestal which will allow any wand it contains to siphon off the compound vis from nearby nodes. Unfortunately each point of compound vis is broken down into a single point of primal vis and all the excess energy is lost. However it is a good start and you are sure you will discover better ways to access this resource. 
#
tc.research_name.ETHEREALBLOOM=Ethereal Bloom
tc.research_text.ETHEREALBLOOM=Purifying Flower
tc.research_page.ETHEREALBLOOM.1=Shimmerleaf is often overshadowed by its mystical neighbour the Silverwood tree, but it has magical properties of it's own.<BR>Like the Silverwood, Shimmerleaf flowers have purifying properties that lie dorment. You have found a way to awaken these properties and turn it into an Ethereal Bloom.<BR>Ethereal blooms slowly, but surely, restores land corrupted by mystical means to its former glory - this includes the blight known as Taint. While it cannot combat Taint directly, few tainted growths can survive outside their native environment for long and tend to die back.
tc.research_page.ETHEREALBLOOM.2=The flower only purifies the land bathed in its light out to a range of about 8 blocks.<BR>Ethereal Blooms are quite fragile and breaking them will turn them back into a Shimmerleaf flower.
