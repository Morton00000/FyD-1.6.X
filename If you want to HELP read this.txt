These are things that need to be done but I have no plans to work on any time soon.
This also means that if some one does textures for these things it will likely be put in and not touched for a long time.

*Tree Logs (just so much stuff)
*Leaves (just so much stuff)
*Saplings (just so much stuff)
*Planks (just so much stuff)

Extra Trees Mix Patterns (just so much stuff)

Anything to do with Biblio Craft (nothing against the creator I just hate models)

Anything that doesn't already have a texture in Metallurgy (just so much stuff)

Most anything in the Universal Electricity folder

Steves Carts 2 (just so much stuff I need to figure out)(also I don't tend to mess with these things when I'm playing)

*Applies to these mods: (These have to match with ones of the same kind across mods)
BOP
Forestry
Extra Trees (Binnie Mods)
Natura
